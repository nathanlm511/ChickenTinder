# ChickenTinder

When youâ€™re having a tough time deciding on a place to eat, you and your friends can go onto Chicken Tinder to
make the decision process easy and fun! Just create a group and have all of your friends use the room code to join.
Using geolocation, nearby restaurants show up on your screens with pictures, menus, prices, and descriptions. 
You can then swipe right on restaurants you're interested in, or swipe left on restaurants you would like to pass. 
Once a certain number of people have swiped right on the same restaurant, everyone's screens will display the voted
restaurant. An anonymous, fair, and fun voting process!
